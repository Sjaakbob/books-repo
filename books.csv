A Sherlock Holmes Novel: A Study in Scarlet,Arthur Conan Doyle,Yes,English,"Great book! In comparison to the BBC serie, Sherlock is more down to earth, happy, doesnt know as much about everything but rather a few specific scientific subjects. Much more calm and less over the top story. He isnt as autistic and lonewolfy as in the BBC show which I really like. The second part of the book focussing on the mormons is much more boring and would be a ""no"" if it was a separate story "

The Lamp,Agatha Christie,No,English,"I do wonder why I keep thinking ghost stories could be fun, only to be completely bored. "
One of These Days,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,Maybe,English,"Nice setting and undertone but it leans too much on indirect messages, abstract conception. It had more potential if you ask me"

The Verdict,Edith Wharton,No,English,Not my thing
The Devoted Friend,Oscar Wilde,Yes,English,Fun meta little fairy tale
A Tale of Two Cities,Charles Dickens,Yes,English,"At times rather funny but I don't know if that was intentional or just the way books were written back then. It switches between a serious novel to random monthy python esque sketches.  The language used is tricky though and it feels like I sometimes loose a bit of the plot because of the complex ways of describing things.  Also much repetition, mont senieur, mont senieur! Interesting opening line:""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, "" Describtion of the madame guilotine was also funny. Nevertheless the book is long and hard for me to follow. Could have been shortened to about 25% of it's size and it would have been a good book. Now I consider it too slow and a bit boring. It does get much much better towards the end."

A Discovery in the Woods,Graham Greene,Yes,English,Lord of the flies vibes. Decent enough

When Greek meets Greek,Graham Greene,Yes,English,Unique story
Two Friends,Guy de Maupassant,Yes,English,Nice twist
A Meeting,Guy de Maupassant,No,English,Fairly boring. Perhaps because I've read similar stories before and I only have so much enjoyment I can get out of this type of story

A Good Man Is Hard to Find,Flannery O'Connor,Yes,English,The plottwist redeems the story

The Distance to the Moon,Italo Calvino,Maybe,English,"Bonus points for being weird, still fairly boring"
Things,D H Lawrence,Yes,English,"Unique story, talks about never ending human desire for new experiences."
Confido,Kurt Vonnegut,Maybe,English,Decent but a bit too straightforward
Story of Your Life / arrival ,Ted Chiang,Yes,English,"Cool and unique writing style and story. That said, it was pretty obvious the  written Alien language was quite similar to Chinese Characters but they ommited this referenced for some  unknown reason. It broke the uncanny valley.
