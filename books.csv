Daughter of the Empire / Dochter van het Keizerrijk, Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurts,Yes,Dutch,"I read this a long time ago and only recently found the name of the book. I recall liking the samurai and fuedal Japan style fantasy book. Honor plays a big rule in the society for example. It has some unique elements like the swords that break quickly and the portal to a different world that changes things from time to time. Still I also distinctly recall not liking the amount of luck the protaganist has, especially  when it came to finding the best spy master in the world basically for free. I never like an over reliance on luck in stories and this book has it in spades. All in all a decent read. "

Meno,Plato,Yes,English,
Apology of Socrates,Plato,Yes,English,
Pheado,Plato,Yes,English,
In the Service of Samurai,Gloria Oliver,Maybe,English,More tailered towards a younger audience. It has some good bits but I read this as an adult after having read many other fantasy novels. This book was a bit too mediocre to really make a lasting impression. 
Koran,Alah,No,English,Death to the unbeliever and praise Alah! That's the general summary
The Art of War,Sun Tzu,Yes,English,"Interesting with some good advice for generals or managers alike and great for it's time. That said, It's not this bible of war as some call it. It lacks too much"
The Corsican Brothers,Alexandre Dumas,Absolutely!,English,This one is between a Yes and a Absolutely! for me. Because it's so short and powerful I have chosen the latter option
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,Robert Louis Stevenson,Absolutely!,English,Questioning good and evil in a creative way
Dracula,Bram Stoker,Maybe,English,"Perhaps because I usually find horry stories boring perhaps because it was one of the first in the genre, but either way Dracula is not that compelling to me"

Grimm's Fairy Tales / Children's and Household Tales,Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,Yes,English,"Remarkable gruesome for a childrens book. It's ofcourse more of a collecting of short stories.

Miss Brill,Katherine Mansfield,No,English,Okayish
How the Camel got his Hump,Rudyard Kipling,Yes,English,Funny little fairy tale
The Catcher in the Rye,J.D Salinger,No,English,"Most of the interest in this story comes from the unique way of looking at the world by the main character. He dislikes everything and all that happens to him he twists into thinking it's something bad. Still, that could have been conveyed within 20min or so, intstead it dragged on and on. It also had a boring ending"

My Old Man,Ernest Hemingway,No,English,Boring
The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy,John J. Mearsheimer Stephen M. Walt,Maybe,English,Interesting book even though I disagree with many positions. Biggest Issue I have is that it feels more like an opinion piece rather than hard data. I do like Mearsheimers stance on free speech and open debate though but I feel like he is somewhat dishonest and one sided. 
A Friend in Need,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Dark and nice
The Bum,Somerset Maugham,Maybe,English,After explanation it's an interesting idea. The bum is what once was the writer.
The Consul,Somerset Maugham,No,English,I don't understand it

The Social Sense,Somerset Maugham,No,English,Not that interesting
In a Strange Land,Somerset Maugham,No,English,Not interesting 
The Witcher 1: The Last Wish,Andrzej Sapkowski,Yes,English,More of a collection of small stories fairy tale style than a real book but still entertainable.

Three Hours Between Planes,F Scott Fitzgerald,Yes,English,Short story with a nice comtemplation about getting older
A New Leaf,F Scott Fitzgerald,Yes,English,Good tragic story
The Witcher 2: Sword of Destiny,Andrzej Sapkowski,Yes,English,Second Witcher book. Pretty decent with some issues. Random creatures that have imbalanced powers. For example the changelings. This was a small side story but the changeling could be considered one of the most powerful creatures around that could have easily changed the whole flow of the story. Instead you meet them for one or two chapters and they are never spoken of again. Feels weird.
An Official Position,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Nice little story
The Happy Couple,Somerset Maugham,Maybe,English,Decent
The Case of The Perfect Maid,Agatha Christie,Maybe,English,Well written but not my cup of tea
Now I Lay Me,Ernest Hemingway,No,English,Boring

An Egyptian Cigarette,Kate Chopin,Maybe,English,"Fancy words, decent story"
A Sherlock Holmes Novel: A Study in Scarlet,Arthur Conan Doyle,Yes,English,"Great book! In comparison to the BBC serie, Sherlock is more down to earth, happy, doesnt know as much about everything but rather a few specific scientific subjects. Much more calm and less over the top story. He isnt as autistic and lonewolfy as in the BBC show which I really like. The second part of the book focussing on the mormons is much more boring and would be a ""no"" if it was a separate story "
The Portrait of a Gentleman,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Almost a Absolutely!. Life through poker
A String of Beads,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Meta story about stories about beads
Das Rätsel,Brothers Grimm,Yes,German,Kinda weird but fun little fairytale 
The Treasure,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Surprisingly fun considering the subject matter
Men At Work,Graham Greene,Yes,English,Funny little story
The Closed Shop,Somerset Maugham,Maybe,English,Peculiar story about a law slowly being changed. Not really my thing though.

THE HANDSOMEST DROWNED MAN IN THE WORLD,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,Yes,English,Strangly intriguing tale about imagination
THE JILTING OF GRANNY WEATHERALL,Katherine Anne Porter,Yes,English,"Maybe even a Absolutely! Really good book about death, memories and the end of life"
A DRIVE IN THE COUNTRY,Graham Greene,Yes,English,Feel a bit conflicted about this one. I liked the boyfriend arc but the rest was kinda meh
The Lamp,Agatha Christie,No,English,"I do wonder why I keep thinking ghost stories could be fun, only to be completely bored. "
One of These Days,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,Maybe,English,"Nice setting and undertone but it leans too much on indirect messages, abstract conception. It had more potential if you ask me"
The Dispenser of Holy Water,Guy de Maupassant,No,English,"Boring ending. I was waiting for a strong plot twist. The story was building up to it but alas, it turned out to be a very mundane finish.  "
Solitude,Guy de Maupassant,Absolutely!,English,Nice contemplation of loneliness and human existance 
A Sherlock Holmes Novel: The Sign of the Four,Arthur Conan Doyle,No,English,Hard to concentrate when reading this one. Too long and uninteresting for me
1 A Scandal in Bohemia from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,Arthur Conan Doyle,Yes,English,Better more fun little story
Die Maus mit dem mutigen Herz,Susanne Bohne,Yes,German,Cute little story
Mupf das Müllmonster,Susanne Bohne,Yes,German,Cute little story
The Invisible Japanese Gentlemen,Graham Greene,Absolutely!,English,Made me smile! Fun little story about observation
The Inn of the Two Witches,Joseph Conrad,No,English,Boring horror book
The Verdict,Edith Wharton,No,English,Not my thing
The Devoted Friend,Oscar Wilde,Yes,English,Fun meta little fairy tale
A Tale of Two Cities,Charles Dickens,Yes,English,"At times rather funny but I don't know if that was intentional or just the way books were written back then. It switches between a serious novel to random monthy python esque sketches.  The language used is tricky though and it feels like I sometimes loose a bit of the plot because of the complex ways of describing things.  Also much repetition, mont senieur, mont senieur! Interesting opening line:""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, "" Describtion of the madame guilotine was also funny. Nevertheless the book is long and hard for me to follow. Could have been shortened to about 25% of it's size and it would have been a good book. Now I consider it too slow and a bit boring. It does get much much better towards the end."
The Ransom,Cutliffe Hyne,Yes,English,
A Discovery in the Woods,Graham Greene,Yes,English,Lord of the flies vibes. Decent enough
Roman Fever,Edith Wharton,Yes,English,Tricky start but interesting plot twists. Women really are aliens sometimes. 
The Hint of an Explanation,Graham Greene,Maybe,English,Interesting premise but boring ending
When Greek meets Greek,Graham Greene,Yes,English,Unique story
Two Friends,Guy de Maupassant,Yes,English,Nice twist
A Meeting,Guy de Maupassant,No,English,Fairly boring. Perhaps because I've read similar stories before and I only have so much enjoyment I can get out of this type of story
Beyond the Bayou,Kate Chopin,No,English,Not interested
A Good Man Is Hard to Find,Flannery O'Connor,Yes,English,The plottwist redeems the story
A Pair of Silk Stockings,Kate Chopin,Maybe,English,"Meh, had potential but ultimately, meh."
The Distance to the Moon,Italo Calvino,Maybe,English,"Bonus points for being weird, still fairly boring"
Things,D H Lawrence,Yes,English,"Unique story, talks about never ending human desire for new experiences and the things we cling to. It had many interesting themes in one"
Confido,Kurt Vonnegut,Maybe,English,Decent but a bit too straightforward
Story of Your Life / arrival ,Ted Chiang,Yes,English,"Cool and unique writing style and story. That said, it was pretty obvious the  written Alien language was quite similar to Chinese Characters but they ommited this referenced for some  unknown reason. It broke the uncanny valley. Somewhere in between a Yes and Absolutely for me, at some point in the future I wanna reasses. "
Just Before the War With the Eskimos,J D Salinger,No,English,Not good. Not really sure what the point was
The Lauging Man,J D Salinger,No,English,Weird and boring

The Romantic Young Lady,Somerset Maugham,No,English,Weak story
Discworld 1:  Colour Of Magic,Terry Pratchett,Yes,English,"""the gods had a habbit of going to atheist's houses, and smashing their windows"" One of the funnier books I've read. The main issue is that it's a bit long winded"
Why Don't You Dance?,Raymond Carver,No,English,I don't get it. 
THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY,Aldous Huxley,No,English,"""The form of the moon can only be known through ones own eyes"" So no one else can tell you about it's shape? It cannot be measured? Wise sounding bullshit that can easily be demonstrated to be false. I found this particular sentence to be emblamatic of the whole thesis. The sentences are well written but the substance seems to be mostly nonesense.  "
Mr Know All,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Fun twist and well told.
The Promise,Somerset Maugham,No,English,He has a good writing style but this story was fairly pointless
Battleground,Lester del Rey,Yes,English,"Pretty predictable sci fi trope. Still, fairly alright"
The Facts of Life,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Took some different turns than I expected. Read a bit like an old fairy tale. Nice  story overall
In the Graveyard,Anton Chekhov,No,English,One of Anton's many stories I don't really understand. I feel like much is either lost in translation or I am missing something else entirely
A Perfect Day for Bananafish,J.D. Salinger,Maybe,English,I like the darker side but it felt... lacking somewhat.
Too Much Tolerance,Evelyn Waugh,Yes,English,Much truth to this little short story. I think we all know all least one person like this in real life
Out of Depth,Evelyn Waugh,Maybe,English,"Mixed feelings about this one. One of the commenters said it best: ""This is less a short story and more the beginning of a dystopian novel; the middle is more notes to be fleshed out later. Parts of it have no sense because there is no reference to anchor any if it. Very strange and going nowhere."""
The Witcher 4: The Time of Contempt,Andrzej Sapkowski,Yes,English,"I was very close to giving this a ""maybe"" instead of a yes. The beginning especially was quite boring. For example the focus on some random character at the start that didnt matter. Also a much bigger focus on Yennefer, whom I consider an annoying character. I think the whole series would have been much better off had she died in the first or second book. The parts about Ciri are somewhat more entertainable but I still would have prefered the story to only center around Gerald. In particular because Ciri has even more obvious plot armor than Gerald. She is young and weak and yet survives everything. Andrzej Sapkowski does do some interesting meta things when writing. Especially when 2 characters are having a conversation with one another. It's a mixed bag though and some of the things feel a bit overused like one guy telling a story and the other guy then saying: ""go on"". In this book the politics are more important compared to to the previous books and the monster hunting is almost completely left behind. It's refreshing for the story but I do feel like the author isn't as good of a politcs story writer as he is a monster hunter writer. "
Story of the Siren,E.M. Forster,No,English,Bullshit story
The Dance,D H Lawrence,No,English,Not interesting to me
The Killers,Ernest Hemingway,No,English,I am really failing to see the point of this story. Nothing happened.
The Lady with the Dog,Anton Chekhov,No,English,Boring love story. I understand the appeal comes from the many faces people have and the difference between real love and temporary lust but it's just not my cup of tea.
THE THREE FAT WOMEN FROM ANTIBES,Somerset Maugham,Absolutely!,English,"""Human nature is weak, and you must not ask too much of it"" well put. Funny and unique story. Really cool perspective that isn't talked about that much in books. At least, not the books that I normally read"
Her Turn,D H Lawrence,No,English,Pointless and boring
APPEARANCE AND REALITY,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,"Decent story of love, betrayel, reconciliation and also just pragmatic choices"
 Bible - Ecclesiastes,God,No,English,"All is vanity. ""let thou words be few. a fools voice is known by a multitude of words"" like the Bible?"
The Grave by the Handpost,Thomas Hardy,maybe,English,"Decent story about fate and accidents, misfortune."
The Sisters,James Joyce,No,English,Boring
The Gale Across the Moors,R.T. Leader,Yes,English,Fun dark little destopian story
青蛙王子,Unknown,Mabye,English,Read it for language learning purposes 
The Other Side of the Hedge,E M Forster,Yes,English,Decent because it's short but not super special
THE FALL OF EDWARD BARNARD,Somerset Maugham,Absolutely!,English,Great story about the choices we make in life and how some of us change drastically
THE LOCKET,Kate Chopin,Maybe,English,Had more potential
A WINTER COURTSHIP,Sarah O Jewett,No,English,Not my cup of tea. Interesting accents although difficult to understant.
DESIREE'S BABY,Kate Chopin,Maybe,English,The name gave the plot away but even without it not really my thing
The Imp and the Crust,Leo Tolstoy,Absolutely!,English,Fantastic short story! Very creative and with interesting insights into the human heart
THE DUKE'S REAPPEARANCE,,,,Lenard is apparently a woman's name in certain parts
BY THE MORNING BOAT,Sarah O Jewett,Yes,English,Interesting focus point of a story. I could feel the mixed emotion of excitment and sadness.
THE FOUR DUTCHMEN,Somerset Maugham,Maybe,English,Decent but nothing special
THE MOTHER,Somerset Maugham,Yes,English,Super interesting! Passion
Barbarenzaken,Philip Droge,Absolutely!,Dutch,Historical mini novel with some interesting perspectives. Funnily enough they mentioned the governments in Europe being quick whereas the Chinese government was slow. Nowadays the reverse is considered true by most people. Also some interesting perspectives on racism. Quite a lot of info for such a short book.  
A BRAVE BOY,C S Sleight,No,English,Mini children's story. 
Zwerkbal door de eeuwen heen / Quidditch Through the Ages,J K Rowling,Yes,English,Pretty funny little book
The Sentimentality of William Tavener,Willa Cather,Yes,English,Interesting and unique
Hills like White Elephants,Ernest Hemingway,Maybe,English,The metaphor is alright but the story is still kinda meh
Cat in the Rain,Ernest Hemingway,No,English,Not really sure what the point was
A DEATH IN THE DESERT,Willa Cather,Yes,English,Gaylord is a real name? Anyway I like the themes in this book but not so much the story telling
The Picture of Dorian,Oscar Wild,Absolutely!,English,"""The ugly and stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.  If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat."" ""The only things one never regrets, are ones mistakes"" A truly fascinating book. I particulary like lord Henry. It's as if he wants to sell you every bad thing life has to offer, all the while persuading you it's for the best. A mix between Cartmen from South Park and Marcus Aurelius. An intense book filled with interesting perspectives even when I disagree with them. ""It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner, that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect just as vulgarity affects us, they give an impression of shear brute force, and we revolt against that."" I do feel like the later parts of the book are not as good. I would have preferd it  if the book stopped at chapter 8."
THE CIRCUS AT DENBY,Sarah O Jewett,No,English,Not really sure what the point was
The wheel of time: The Dragon Reborn,Robert Jordan,Maybe,English,"Decent but like the other books in the series, it has a lot of flaws. The main characters (Rand in particular but also the others) keep doubting and not making a choice. There are some other annoying things like the authors tendency to keep repeating the word Aes Sedai, most characters being angry for no reason etc. The world is interesting but the characters are kinda dull. Mat is the only interesting one. "
"THE TROLL GARDEN, Flavia and Her Artists",Willa Cather,No,English,I really don't give a fuck about this kind of story
